\title{Collapse an outcome matrix to synthetic control form}
\usage{
collapsed.form(Y, N0, T0)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Outcome matrix with control units first and pre-treatment periods first.}

\item{N0}{Number of control units (rows).}

\item{T0}{Number of pre-treatment periods (columns).}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of dimension \code{N0 + 1} by \code{T0 + 1} where
the final row and column contain treated averages.
}
\description{
Aggregates post-treatment rows and columns into averages so the final row and
column represent treated units and treated periods. This is a convenience for
algorithms that expect a \code{(N0 + 1) x (T0 + 1)} matrix with the treated
block compressed to a single row and column.
