\title{Combine decreasing sequences while respecting terminal NA markers}
\usage{
pairwise.sum.decreasing(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{Numeric vectors, typically monotone decreasing with trailing
\code{NA} entries.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of pairwise sums with shared terminal \code{NA}
retained.
}
\description{
Treats \code{NA} as a sentinel indicating that a series has stopped
decreasing and should hold its last non-\code{NA} value. Returns the
element-wise sum with terminal \code{NA} preserved where both series ended.
