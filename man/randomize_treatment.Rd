\usage{
randomize_treatment(pi, N, N1)
}
\arguments{
\item{pi}{Randomization probabilities.}

\item{N}{Number of units.}

\item{N1}{Maximum number of treated units to allow.}
}
\value{
A binary vector of length \code{N} indicating treatment assignment.
}
\description{
Draws binary assignments with probability \code{pi} and enforces at least one
treated unit and no more than \code{N1}. Excess treated units are dropped at
random; if none are treated, units are promoted at random.
